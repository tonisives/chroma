# Overview

`juice-buyback` provides a [data source](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/learn/glossary/data-source/) and [delegate](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/learn/glossary/delegate/) which maximise the [project token](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/learn/glossary/tokens/) received by the contributor when they call `pay` on the [terminal](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/learn/glossary/payment-terminal/). In order to do so, the delegate will either mint new tokens from the project ("vanilla" path, bypassing the delegate) or use the funds from `pay` to buy existing tokens in a Uniswap V3 pool ("buyback" path), depending on the best quote available at the time of the call.

This first iteration is optimised for ETH as terminal token.

## About Juicebox

The Juicebox protocol is a programmable treasury. Projects can use it to configure how its tokens should be minted when it receives funds, and under what conditions those funds can be distributed to preprogrammed addresses or reclaimed by its community. These rules can evolve over funding cycles, allowing people to bootstrap open-ended projects and add structure, constraints, extensions, and incentives over time as needed.

When people pay a project, they interact with a [payment terminal](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/learn/glossary/payment-terminal/), a contract which controls the inflows and outflows of a certain token for every project which uses it. Projects can override the default payment terminal behavior through the use of data sources and delegates.

A [data source](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/learn/glossary/data-source/) is used to provide custom data to a payment terminal's `pay` (or `redeem`) function. Data sources must adhere to [`IJBFundingCycleDataSource`](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/api/interfaces/ijbfundingcycledatasource/).

A [pay delegate](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/learn/glossary/delegate/) includes a custom `didPay(...)` hook that will execute after all of the default protocol pay logic has successfully executed in the terminal contract. Pay delegates must adhere to [`IJBPayDelegate`](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/api/interfaces/ijbpaydelegate/).

`juice-buyback` is an `IJBPayDelegate` *and* an `IJBFundingCycleDataSource`.

You can find the previous Code4rena contest covering the protocol, inlcuding the payment terminal [here](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-10-juicebox/).
